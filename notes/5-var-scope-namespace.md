## Variable Scope and Namespaces in Python
This concept page aims to explain variable scope and namespaces, essential concepts for managing variables effectively in your Python programs. 

You’ll learn about different scopes, their behavior, and best practices for clean and maintainable code.

## Introduction

```md
Variables are like containers that store data such as numbers, text, lists, etc. 

When you create a variable, you are essentially allocating space in your computer’s memory to hold that data. 

However, how and where you define a variable determines where it can be accessed in your code. Understanding variable scope and namespaces is crucial for writing organized and error-free Python code.

```
## Variable scope indepth
```md
## Variable Scope
Variable scope defines the accessibility of a variable within your code. Different scopes create a hierarchy that determines where Python searches for a variable name.

## Types of Scopes (LEGB Rule)

## Python follows the LEGB rule for variable lookup:

- L (Local): Variables defined within a function or block have local scope. They are only accessible within that function or block.

- E (Enclosing): If a variable is not found locally, Python searches enclosing functions (nested functions) for the variable.

- G (Global): Variables defined outside all functions have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the program.

- B (Built-in): Built-in functions and variables are part of Python’s core functionality and are always accessible.
```

## Example of variable scope
```md
count = 10  # Global variable

def outer_function():
  count = 5  # Local variable within outer_function

  def inner_function():
    count = 2  # Local variable within inner_function
    print(f"Inner function: {count}")  # Accesses local count (2)

  inner_function()
  print(f"Outer function: {count}")  # Accesses local count (5)

print(f"Global scope: {count}")  # Accesses global count (10)

outer_function()


## Best Practices for Variable Scope

Favor local variables for function-specific data.
Use global variables sparingly and only when truly necessary.
Consider using nonlocal variables for modifying variables from enclosing functions (advanced concept).
```
## Exploring Namespaces

```md
## What are Namespaces?

In Python, a namespace is like a container that holds names (variables, functions, classes, etc.) mapped to their corresponding objects (values, code blocks, etc.). Namespaces help organize and manage names in your code to avoid conflicts between different parts of your program.

## Preventing Naming Conflicts

Consider a scenario where you have two variables with the same name but different purposes in your code. Without namespaces, there would be ambiguity, and Python wouldn’t know which variable you are referring to.


## Type of NameSpaces in Python

- Built-in Namespace: Contains built-in functions and variables accessible throughout your program (e.g., print, len).

- Global Namespace: Holds variables defined at the top level of your script or module.
Local Namespace: Created for each function and block, containing local variables defined within that scope.

- Module Namespace: Each imported module has its own namespace to avoid conflicts with global names.

## Namespace Lifecycle and scope Resolution
Global Namespace: When you start a Python program, a global namespace is created. This namespace holds names (variables, functions, classes) defined at the outermost level of your code, outside of any functions or classes.

Local Namespace (Function Scope): Whenever a function is called, a new local namespace is created for that function. This namespace contains names specific to that function, including function parameters and local variables defined inside the function.
Scope Resolution and LEGB Rule:


L: Python first looks for a variable name in the local namespace (current function scope). If the variable is found, Python uses that value.
E: If the variable is not found in the local namespace, Python searches in the enclosing (or non-local) namespaces. This process continues until the variable is found or until the global namespace is reached.


G: If the variable is not found in the local or enclosing namespaces, Python looks in the global namespace (module-level scope).


B: If the variable is still not found, Python checks the built-in namespace, which contains built-in functions and objects.
```
