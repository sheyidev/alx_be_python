## Introduction
Data structures are fundamental building blocks in Python that organize and store collections of data.Data structures are like containers that allow you to organize and store collections of data in a structured and efficient way. Think of them as different types of boxes or organizers where you can put your data items. Choosing the right data structure for your task is crucial for efficient code and memory usage.

## Here’s a brief overview of common data structures:

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items enclosed in square brackets []. They can hold elements of different data types and allow duplicate values.

Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections of items similar to lists but enclosed in parentheses (). Once created, their elements cannot be changed.

Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces {}. Sets are useful for removing duplicates and checking element membership.

Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries are efficient for storing data associated with labels.
