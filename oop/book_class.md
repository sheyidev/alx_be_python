## Dive into Python Magic Methods
```md




Objective: Master Python magic methods by implementing a Book class that incorporates constructors (__init__), destructors (__del__), and the representation methods (__str__ and __repr__).

Task Description:
Create a Python script named book_class.py. In this script, define a Book class that uses specific magic methods to enhance its functionality. This class will model a book with attributes for the title, author, and publication year.

Requirements for Book Class in book_class.py:
Attributes:

title (str): The title of the book.
author (str): The author of the book.
year (int): The publication year of the book.
Magic Methods:

Constructor (__init__): Initializes a Book instance with title, author, and year.
Destructor (__del__): Prints "Deleting (title of the book)" upon object deletion.
String Representation (__str__): Returns a string in the format "(title) by (author), published in (year)".
Official Representation (__repr__): Returns a string that would recreate the Book instance: f"Book('{self.title}', '{self.author}', {self.year})".
Provided for Testing: main.py
To test your Book class, use the following main.py script, which demonstrates creating a Book instance and utilizing the implemented magic methods:

from book_class import Book

def main():
    # Creating an instance of Book
    my_book = Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949)

    # Demonstrating the __str__ method
    print(my_book)  # Expected to use __str__

    # Demonstrating the __repr__ method
    print(repr(my_book))  # Expected to use __repr__

    # Deleting a book instance to trigger __del__
    del my_book

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Expected Output:
1984 by George Orwell, published in 1949
Book('1984', 'George Orwell', 1949)
Deleting 1984
