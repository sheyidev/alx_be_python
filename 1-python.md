## Procedural Programming:
Imagine you’re following a recipe. Each step guides you through a specific action, like mixing ingredients or baking a cake.

 Procedural programming works in a similar way! It’s a style of programming that breaks down problems into a sequence of instructions, just like the steps in a recipe. These instructions are then executed one after the other to achieve the desired outcome.

## Here are some key characteristics of procedural programming:

Focus on Procedures: Procedures (also called functions) are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Think of them as mini-recipes within your main program.

Top-Down Approach: Procedural programs follow a top-down approach, like following a recipe. The code executes instructions one line at a time, from beginning to end.

Data and Logic Separation: Data (information) and the procedures that operate on that data are often treated separately. This can make code easier to understand and modify.


## Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
Here’s a sneak peek at some cool OOP features:

Classes:Imagine a Lego instruction sheet - that’s a class! It tells you what parts (properties) your object needs (like wheels for a car) and what it can do (methods like “drive”).

Objects: These are the actual Legos you build with! Each object is built from a class and has its own unique properties (a red car) and can do the things its class allows (vroom vroom!).

Inheritance: Ever build a cool spaceship using leftover car pieces? Inheritance is like that! New classes (spaceship) can inherit properties (wheels) and abilities (movement) from existing ones (car).

Encapsulation: Think of a Lego set with a special opening to put the pieces inside. Encapsulation keeps an object’s insides hidden, letting you interact with it only through specific ways (like buttons).

Polymorphism: Imagine using the same key to open different doors. Polymorphism lets objects of different classes respond in their own way to the same command, making code more flexible (one key, many uses!).
