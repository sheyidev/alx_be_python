## Introduction to Relational Database Concepts
```md
## Tables
- A table is a fundamental component of a relational database, which stores data in a structured format.
- Tables consist of rows (records) and columns (fields).
- Each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as “Customers,” “Orders,” or “Products.”
- Tables are defined with a schema that specifies the names of columns, data types, and constraints.


## Rows
- Rows, also known as records, represent individual instances or occurrences of the entity represented by the table.
- Each row in a table contains a unique set of values for the columns defined in the table’s schema.
- For example, in a “Customers” table, each row would represent a single customer with their respective data (name, address, email, etc.).


## Columns
- Columns, also known as fields, define the attributes or characteristics of the entity represented by the table.
- Each column has a name and a specific data type (e.g., text, numeric, date, etc.) that defines the type of data it can store.
- Columns often have constraints, such as “NOT NULL” to ensure that a value is always provided, or “UNIQUE” to prevent duplicate values.
- For example, in a “Customers” table, columns might include “CustomerID,” “FirstName,” “LastName,” “Email,” and “Phone.”


## Relationships
- Relational databases allow tables to be related to each other through the use of primary keys and foreign keys.
- A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
- Relationships enable data to be efficiently queried and combined from multiple tables, ensuring data integrity and eliminating redundancy.

## Introduction to SQL

Introduction to SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It serves as the standard language for interacting with SQL databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

SQL provides a standardized way to perform various operations on databases, including creating, modifying, and querying data. It uses a structured, English-like syntax, making it relatively easy to learn and understand, even for non-programmers

SQL is a declarative language, meaning that you specify what data you want to retrieve or manipulate, rather than providing step-by-step instructions on how to do it. 

It is widely adopted and supported by various database management systems (DBMS), ensuring portability and compatibility across different platforms. SQL is essential for data analysts, database administrators, and developers working with relational databases and data-driven applications.

## SQL Syntax and Structure
```md
## SQL Syntax and Structure
SQL follows a specific syntax and structure, consisting of various statements and clauses. Understanding the syntax and structure is crucial for writing correct and efficient SQL queries.

SQL statements can be categorized into several types, including:

- Data Definition Language (DDL): Used for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects like tables and indexes (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used for inserting, updating, and deleting data within tables (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Data Query Language (DQL): Used for retrieving data from tables (e.g., SELECT).
- Data Control Language (DCL): Used for managing user access and permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).




## SQL Data Types
SQL supports various data types to store different kinds of data in a database. Here are some common SQL data types:

Numeric Types: Used to store numbers. Examples: INTEGER, SMALLINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT.
Character Types: Used to store text data. Examples: CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT.
Date and Time Types: Used to store date and time values. Examples: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP.
Boolean Type: Used to store logical values (true or false). Example: BOOLEAN.


Data types are important because they define the kind of data that can be stored in a column and ensure data integrity by preventing invalid data from being inserted.



```
## Basic SQL operations 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  HireDate DATE
);

```

```md
This statement creates a new table named “Employees” with columns for EmployeeID (as the primary key), FirstName, LastName, Email (with a unique constraint), and HireDate. The data types for each column are specified, and constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE are applied.

```
## Inserting Data into a Table 
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Email, HireDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2022-05-15');

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Email, HireDate)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '2021-08-22'),
       (3, 'Michael', 'Johnson', 'michael.johnson@example.com', '2023-02-01');


```

```md
These statements insert new records (rows) into the “Employees” table. 

The first statement inserts a single record, while the second statement demonstrates how to insert multiple records in one statement by separating the value sets with commas.

## Selecting Data from a Table

SELECT * FROM Employees;

## This statement retrieves all columns and rows from the “Employees” table.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email FROM Employees;

## This statement retrieves only the FirstName, LastName, and Email columns from the “Employees” table.
