## More about OOP

```md
This project dives deeper into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

You’ll explore advanced concepts like constructors, destructors, magic methods, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and more.

```

## Project Objectives 
```md
Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Describe the functionalities of constructors (__init__), destructors (__del__), and common magic methods (e.g., __str__, __repr__) in Python classes.



Implement inheritance to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
Utilize composition as an alternative to inheritance for building complex objects.



Explain the concepts of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in Python.


Understand the method resolution order (MRO) in Python and how it affects method calls in inheritance hierarchies.



Implement polymorphism and method overriding to create flexible and reusable code.



Explain and use Python’s duck typing to achieve polymorphic behavior.


Distinguish between class methods and static methods based on their usage and purpose.


Apply @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators appropriately in your Python classes.


This project will equip you with a comprehensive understanding of advanced OOP concepts in Python, enabling you to design and build robust and maintainable object-oriented applications.
